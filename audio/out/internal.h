/* Note:
 *
 * In general, there are two types of audio drivers:
 *  a) push based (the user queues data that should be played)
 *  b) pull callback based (the audio API calls a callback to get audio)
 *
 * The ao.c code can handle both. It basically implements two audio paths
 * and provides a uniform API for them. If ao_driver->play is NULL, it assumes
 * that the driver uses a callback based audio API, otherwise push based.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *  a) Most functions (except ->control) must be provided. ->play is called to
 *     queue audio. ao.c creates a thread to regularly refill audio device
 *     buffers with ->play, but all driver functions are always called under
 *     an exclusive lock.
 *     Mandatory:
 *          init
 *          uninit
 *          reset
 *          get_space
 *          play
 *          get_delay
 *          pause
 *          resume
 *  b) ->play must be NULL. The driver can start the audio API in init(). The
 *     audio API in turn will start a thread and call a callback provided by the
 *     driver. That callback calls ao_read_data() to get audio data. Most
 *     functions are optional and will be emulated if missing (e.g. pausing
 *     is emulated as silence). ->get_delay and ->get_space are never called.
 *     Mandatory:
 *          init
 *          uninit
